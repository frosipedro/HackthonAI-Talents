# Banking System Frontend

## Overview

The Banking System Frontend is a web-based application designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing banking operations. It offers a seamless experience for users to handle various banking tasks efficiently.

## 🛠️ Architecture

This frontend application is built using Angular, a robust framework for creating dynamic and responsive web applications. The architecture is modular, ensuring scalability and maintainability. Key highlights include:

- **🧩 Component-Based Design**: Each feature is implemented as a standalone component, promoting reusability and ease of maintenance.
- **🔗 Service-Oriented Communication**: Shared services handle data retrieval and interaction with the backend API.
- **🗺️ Routing**: Angular's Router enables seamless navigation between different screens.
- **📦 State Management**: Built-in Angular tools efficiently manage application state and data flow.

## Getting Started

### 🖥️ Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any source files.

### 🛠️ Code Scaffolding

Angular CLI provides powerful scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (e.g., `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

### 🏗️ Building the Project

To build the project, run:

```bash
ng build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes the application for performance and speed.

### ✅ Running Unit Tests

To execute unit tests using the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, run:

```bash
ng test
```

### 🧪 Running End-to-End Tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Note: Angular CLI does not include an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your project requirements.
