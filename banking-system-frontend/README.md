# BankingSystemFrontend
## Introduction

The Banking System Frontend is a web-based application designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing banking operations. The system includes several key screens, such as:

- **Transaction Reports**: Displays an overview of account balances, recent transactions, and key metrics.
- **Transactions Screen**: Enables users to view, create, and manage financial transactions.
- **Account Management**: Provides tools for managing user profiles, account settings, and linked accounts.

### Architecture

This frontend application is built using Angular, a powerful framework for building dynamic and responsive web applications. The architecture follows a modular design, with features encapsulated into reusable components and services. Key architectural highlights include:

- **Component-Based Structure**: Each screen and feature is implemented as a standalone component, ensuring maintainability and scalability.
- **Service-Oriented Communication**: Shared services handle data retrieval and communication with the backend API.
- **Routing**: Angular's Router is used to manage navigation between screens seamlessly.
- **State Management**: The application leverages Angular's built-in tools for managing state and data flow efficiently.

This architecture ensures a robust, maintainable, and scalable frontend system that meets modern web application standards.
This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.9.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
